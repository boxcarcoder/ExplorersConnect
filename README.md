## Overview
This application was built with the MERN stack.

The backend RESTful API is built with Node.js and Express, communicating with Atlas MongoDB for cloud storage. Models are built with Mongoose for schema creation, while controllers are implemented using Mongoose for CRUD operations. Protected endpoints are built with JSON Web Tokens.

The frontend is built with React, as well as React Redux for state management. Actions and reducers are utilized to provide state from the database to the React components. Styling for components are implemented with SCSS. 

This application is written following ES6+ conventions, including arrow functions, React Hooks, and async/await for asynchronous operations.
